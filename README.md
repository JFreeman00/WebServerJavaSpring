A Java Spring boot webserver im working on for my homemade smarthome. Im using it as the central point for my mobile app and my esp 32. 
The server is connected to a Postgres SQL databas where i right now just can save users. 
For future i want to save the "new device" to the databas so when i start the application i dont have to "create a new device".


Java 17.
Spring v 2.7.0
Apache Maven 3.8.6

Project created in Intellij
